                        A Vastayan known by no name <em>(so far!)</em>. She can appear more humanoid or more animalistic, but she feels at home being right in the middle most of the time.
                        No matter what form she takes, she is always recognizable by the red markings under her eyes and on the sides of her face. 
                        Her powers mainly come from the help of two Vastayashai'rei, a Dragon, and a Tiger. They each gave her powers that represent them,
                        eg. summoning and manipulating fire, and shapeshifting. While this Vastayan can shapeshift already (with limits, like being unable to change her physical
                        form drastically), the Dragon's help expands her shapeshifting ability. She can shapeshift into different species or even specific
                        people, but only for a limited time (approximately a few days). Doing this drains her magic supply, and she'll need to rest to replenish it. For this reason,
                        she had no interest in using this ability often, at least, before the Noxus invasion of Ionia.
