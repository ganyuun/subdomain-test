                        Hi again, I felt like writing about how I ended up confirming a Vastaya fictotype. I first found myself a
                        part of the 'kin community about three years ago. I knew I was some sort of canid creature for sure, but I kept confirming
                        the wrong kintypes and deconfirming them later.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        At first, I thought my kintype was a winged wolf (sorta fitting the "wolf therian stereotype"). It was mostly based on
                        canid and wing phantom shifts (which I still have to this day!! I still haven't figured it out.)  
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Then I thought I was a tanuki, still canid features but very small! It also is a yokai with shapeshifting powers,
                        so that's mainly what led me to confirm it. 
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Dhampir because... I was reading a lot of vampire fiction and was obsessed with it, lol. It wasn't really
                        based on any of my experiences. Needless to say, I deconfirmed this one quickly.

                        <br><br>

                        I thought I was a polymorph for some time because I got frustrated with how many kintypes I was confirming and deconfirming.
                        I also had a lot of cameo shifts, so it really wasn't helping. I'd intensively study shifts of animals I had and confirm them,
                        instead of journaling what I normally experience, which led to my frustration. I even separated myself from the therian community
                        because of it. (But it's not their fault.)
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Then I thought I was an anthro wolf. The anthro part was very close, but wrong species! The fur color was also... very off. At this time,
                        I was realizing that my shifts were often more anthropomorphic than quadruped.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Then, last year I confirmed a (single-tailed??) kitsune kintype, and designed Rie after it for ~self-expression~.
                        I was actually <em>taking notes</em> to figure it out. At the time, I was questioning both fox and kitsune, but I settled
                        with kitsune, because it seemed to fit better at the time.
                        As a note, I had the kitsune kintype for an entire year, which is by far the longest time I'd kept a kintype at that point.
                        But, I realized that I didn't really have multi-tail shifts. I do have phantom-tail shifts, but it's only one. I always chalked
                        it up to being a "young" kitsune, but I did have a creeping suspicion that I didn't really fit. At the same time, I also confirmed
                        eastern-dragon as a kintype, but that didn't really seem to be me. In the end, I realized that it's only important to my identity in the context of being
                        vastaya, but not outside of that.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Anyway, a while afterwards, I (unfortunately) started playing League of Legends and found out about
                        Ahri and the Vastaya. I researched and thought on it for weeks, and it became clear. The shapeshifting, anthropomorphism,
                        it just made sense. I've identified as a Vastaya since March, and the thought of deconfirming it hasn't crossed my mind ever.
                        I still question other animals, like recently hyena, brown bear, or ravens, but they fade away after some time. Right now,
                        I'm trying to figure out the subtype stuff, and figure out what to name my kintype. I know that I'm not a part of a canon Vastaya
                        tribe, so I guess I just have to... make it up? I'm also really excited to get more canon Vastaya lore, but I'm not really counting on it.
                        I'm on some potent copium.
